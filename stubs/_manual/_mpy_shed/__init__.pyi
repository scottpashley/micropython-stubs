    Block devices
    -------------

    A block device is an object which implements the block protocol. This enables a
    device to support MicroPython filesystems. The physical hardware is represented
    by a user defined class. The :class:`AbstractBlockDev` class is a template for
    the design of such a class: MicroPython does not actually provide that class,
    but an actual block device class must implement the methods described below.

    A concrete implementation of this class will usually allow access to the
    memory-like functionality of a piece of hardware (like flash memory). A block
    device can be formatted to any supported filesystem and mounted using ``os``
    methods.

    See :ref:`filesystem` for example implementations of block devices using the
    two variants of the block protocol described below.

    .. _block-device-interface:

    Simple and extended interface
    .............................

    There are two compatible signatures for the ``readblocks`` and ``writeblocks``
    methods (see below), in order to support a variety of use cases.  A given block
    device may implement one form or the other, or both at the same time. The second
    form (with the offset parameter) is referred to as the "extended interface".

    Some filesystems (such as littlefs) that require more control over write
    operations, for example writing to sub-block regions without erasing, may require
    that the block device supports the extended interface.
