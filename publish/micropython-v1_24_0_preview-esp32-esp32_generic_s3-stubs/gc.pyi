    Set or query the additional GC allocation threshold. Normally, a collection
    is triggered only when a new allocation cannot be satisfied, i.e. on an
    out-of-memory (OOM) condition. If this function is called, in addition to
    OOM, a collection will be triggered each time after *amount* bytes have been
    allocated (in total, since the previous time such an amount of bytes
    have been allocated). *amount* is usually specified as less than the
    full heap size, with the intention to trigger a collection earlier than when the
    heap becomes exhausted, and in the hope that an early collection will prevent
    excessive memory fragmentation. This is a heuristic measure, the effect
    of which will vary from application to application, as well as
    the optimal value of the *amount* parameter.

    Calling the function without argument will return the current value of
    the threshold. A value of -1 means a disabled allocation threshold.

    Difference to CPython

       This function is a MicroPython extension. CPython has a similar
       function - ``set_threshold()``, but due to different GC
       implementations, its signature and semantics are different.
